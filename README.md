# Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML)
Aimed at devices with low computational power and low memory. The goal is to have the developed models and projects deployed on embedded devices/micro-controllers with low power.
Projects cover topics in machine learning, deep learning and computer vision. Models developed will be trained with either ready-avalaible datasets or data collected for specific applicationa. training takes place on high performing computers (e.g. gpu, cloud tpu) and deployed on "tiny" devices for inference only.
