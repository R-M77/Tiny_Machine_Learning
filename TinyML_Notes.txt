Lesson 2.2

"""Neurons in code"""

y is a function of x,
y = f(x)

y = w(x)+b

class Model

Machine learning diagram
Make a guess --> Measure accuracy --> optimize guess
--> repeat cycle

def loss(predicted_y, target_y):
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(predicted_y-target_y))

then use gradient tape to calculate loss and train Model
differentiate w's and b's against loss function to get gradients and get directions towards goal. direction of zero loss
