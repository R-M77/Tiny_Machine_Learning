    "# Mask-Detection using Transfer Learning\n",
    "In this assignment you will use transfer learning to detect if the person is wearing a mask or not. We will use a pre-trained model (MobileNet-V1) trained on the ImageNet dataset and use a modified version of [kaggle mask dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/prasoonkottarathil/face-mask-lite-dataset) to preform transfer learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, a pre-trained model is a saved network that was previously trained on a large dataset, typically on a large-scale image-classification task. You either use the pretrained model as is or use transfer learning to customize this model to a given task. The intuition behind transfer learning for image classification is that if a model is trained on a large and general enough dataset, this model will effectively serve as a generic model of the visual world. You can then take advantage of these learned feature maps without having to start from scratch by training a large model on a large dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will customize a pretrained model in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Feature Extraction: Use the representations learned by a previous network to extract meaningful features from new samples. You simply add a new classifier, which will be trained from scratch, on top of the pretrained model so that you can repurpose the feature maps learned previously for the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    " You do not need to (re)train the entire model. The base convolutional network already contains features that are generically useful for classifying pictures. However, the final, classification part of the pretrained model is specific to the original classification task, and subsequently specific to the set of classes on which the model was trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You will follow the general machine learning workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Examine and understand the data\n",
    "1. Build an input pipeline, in this case using Keras ImageDataGenerator\n",
    "1. Compose the model\n",
    "   * Load in the pretrained base model (and pretrained weights)\n",
    "   * Stack the classification layers on top\n",
    "1. Train the model\n",
    "1. Evaluate model\n",

In many image models this is the output of the final convolution BEFORE the flatten layer. You may see this layer referred to as the \"bottleneck layer\" in some texts. Since many machine learning models are defined as the inputs occuring at the bottom and the outputs occuring at the top we would like to ignore the top few classification layers.

When working with a small dataset, it is a common practice to take advantage of features learned by a model trained on a larger dataset in the same domain. \n",
