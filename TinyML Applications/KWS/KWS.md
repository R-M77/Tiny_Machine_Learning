Keyword Spotting Application Architecture

In this reading, we will go over the high-level architecture of the application before we go deep into building the keyword spotting application (KWS).

Machine learning workflow and pipeline. Begins with collection and preprocessing of data then the design and training of a model. These steps are done in TensorFlow. Then a model is optimized, converted and deployed using TensorFlow Lite. Finally inferences are made using TensorFlow Lite Micro.

There are several steps in the ML workflow and this is what each of the stages entails for KWS.

Step 1 Data collection

For Keyword Spotting we need a dataset aligned to individual words that includes thousands of examples which are representative of real world audio (e.g., including background noise).

Step 2: Data Preprocessing

For efficient inference we need to extract features from the audio signal and classify them using a NN. To do this we convert analog audio signals collected from microphones into digital signals that we then convert into spectrograms which you can think of as images of sounds.

Step 3: Model Design

In order to deploy a model onto our microcontroller we need it to be very small. We explore the tradeoffs of such models and just how small they need to be (hint: itâ€™s tiny)!

Step 4: Training

We will train our model using standard training techniques explored in Course 1 and will add new power ways of analyzing your training results, confusion matrices. You will get to train your own keyword spotting model to recognize your choice of words from our dataset. You will get to explore just how accurate (or not accurate) your final model can be!

Step 5: Evaluation
We will then explore what it means to have an accurate model and why your training/validation/test error may be different from the accuracy experienced by users.

Additional Topics:

We will also consider some additional topics that are unique to keyword spotting: post processing and cascade architectures.
